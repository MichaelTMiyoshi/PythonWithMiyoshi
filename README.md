# PythonWithMiyoshi
This is the companion repository for the book that I have not written yet.  I am doing things a little different with this repo.  I have created the problems first and will write the book after I have taught the subject for a couple years.  At least that is the plan.

This repo will change and grow in time with feedback from my students and other readers.

### Notes on Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
I use PyCharm as my IDE.  It works well developing Python projects.  It also works well with GitHub.  As of this time, I do not have projects to clone.  My suggestion is that you use the IDE that works for you and that works well with GitHub.

### What Is a Repo?

It might seem overwhelming if you are learning to program and then you get sent to GitHub to "clone a repo."  Do not worry.  A repo is essentially just a folder where you keep your stuff.  But let us step back a step.  Repo is short for REPOSITORY.  And a repository is just a place to hold stuff.  So a Git or GitHub repo just holds your stuff in a certain way.  (See more at [GitHub: About Repositories](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) page.)

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is an open source control system.  You use it on your local computer and you can also use it to interface with online storage and collaboration spaces like [GitHub](https://GitHub.com/about).  You will need an account if you want to store your own repos on GitHub, but you can clone repos without one.  You can either make GitHub repos public or private.  Private means that only you and anybody you invite to collaborate with you can see your repo(s).  Public is just that, public.  Anybody can see your repo and all that is in it.

So what is cloning?  [Cloning](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) is taking somebody else's public (or private) repo and copying it for your own use on your local computer.  You might just want to see what it does or you might want to change it or you might want to contribute to some project.  Usually, you start by cloning the repo (and thus the project).  If you want to contribute to somebody's project, you will need to [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repo.  Even if you do not want to contribute to somebody else's project, you will fork a repo if you want to keep your own copy of it on GitHub.  Only clone a repo if you are only going to keep it on your local computer.  Which does seems a bit of a waste.

Forking and Cloning and Repos.  Oh my!

Do not worry.  There are lots of resources to help you on your way.  For instance: [Forking vs. Cloning](https://github.community/t5/Support-Protips/The-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-a-repository/ba-p/1372#) and all the links in this section and lots more.
