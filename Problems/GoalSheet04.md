Some problem

**Problem GS4-2 (CSV data)**

Create a comma-delimited file with an int, a float, a character array (no spaces), and a character (in that order) on each of 10 rows.  Write a program to get in the data and then output it into a tab-delimited file.  (Does this look familiar?  This time, make sure to use the CSV module.)  You may use the data below as the data for your file:

```
1,2.3,abcdef,q
2,3.4,ghijklmn,r
3,4.5,opqrstu,s
4,5.6,vw,t
5,6.7,xyzpdq,u
