# Goal Sheet 04

**Problem GS04-01 (Reading data from a file)  (double points)**

Read the data from the population file [citiesLatLongPop.csv](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/PythonWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Problems/citiesLatLongPop.csv) for use in a lookup program.  The program will ask the user for one of several inputs to find the desired data.

Input | Output
------|-------
City name | Population and Latitude and Longitude
Latitude range | List of cities on that Latitude range
Longitude range | List of cities on that Longitude range
Population range | List of cities within given population range
Country abbreviation | List of cities in that country

The program should give the user options and loop until the user chooses to exit.

Note: It would be a good idea to use the [citieslatLongPopSample.csv](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/PythonWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Problems/citiesLatLongPopSample.csv) as a trial before you use the bigger file.  (I would suggest using small datasets when testing any program like this one that uses one or more large datasets.)

**Problem GS04-02 (CSV data)**

Create a comma-delimited file with an int, a float, a character array (no spaces), and a character (in that order) on each of 10 rows.  Write a program to get in the data and then output it into a tab-delimited file.  (Does this look familiar?  This time, make sure to use the CSV module.)  You may use the data below as the data for your file:

```
1,2.3,abcdef,q
2,3.4,ghijklmn,r
3,4.5,opqrstu,s
4,5.6,vw,t
5,6.7,xyzpdq,u
6,7.8,abc123,v
7,8.9,qqqrrrsss,w
8,9.01,tea,x
9,0.12,taxation,y
10,11.12,present,z
```
