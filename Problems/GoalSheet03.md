# Goal Sheet 03

**Problem GS03-01 (Lists)**

Write a program that is passed a number and returns string containing a fortune.  You will decide which fortune (of twenty possible) based on the (random) number that is passed to the function.  The fortunes are contained in a list of strings (local list in the function).  The function must pass the fortune back to the calling function.  Output the fortune in the calling function.  You must loop the program (where the function is called) so that the user can keep getting fortunes until opting to quit.

**Problem GS03-02 (Dictionaries)**

Create two lists with at least 20 items in each of them.  (The lists must be the same size.)  Make sure the first list does not have any duplicates.  Then, create a map from the two lists.  Use the first list (without any duplicates) as the keys, and the second list (which may have duplicates) as the values.  An example of the two lists.  First list: numbers from 1 through 20.  Second list: the squares of those numbers.

Some Problem

**Problem GS03-04 (Files)**
Create a comma-delimited file with an int, a float, a character array (no spaces), and a character (in that order) on each of 10 rows.  Write a program to get in the data and then output it into a tab-delimited file.  (Do so without using the CSV module.  You will do that later.)  You may use the data below as the data for your file:

```
1,2.3,abcdef,q
2,3.4,ghijklmn,r
3,4.5,opqrstu,s
4,5.6,vw,t
5,6.7,xyzpdq,u
6,7.8,abc123,v
7,8.9,qqqrrrsss,w
8,9.01,tea,x
9,0.12,taxation,y
10,11.12,present,z
```

**Problem GS03-06 (major program - earthquakes)**

You gathered some information in the first part of the major program.  Now do something with that information.  Create a global list.  It will contain the earthquakes the user has felt.  Date and size.  Use a function to gather the information and put it into the list.  Loop around that function (keep calling the function) as long as the user has more information to input.
