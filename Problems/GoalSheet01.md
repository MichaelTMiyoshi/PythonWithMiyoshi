**Problem GS01-01 (PBJ)**

Write the directions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly (PBJ) sandwich.  (If you are allergic, give the instructions for making a different kind of sandwich.)  Be specific.  You may make some simple assumptions.  For instance, you may assume that the person making the sandwich (not yourself) knows what a knife is.  Other simple assumptions (like where the bread and other ingredients are) can be made as well.  You will be writing this assuming the person has not make a PBJ before.

Notes:

* I ask my class who is alergic to peanuts and have them write the instructions on how to make an alternative sandwich.
* Grading is for my students.

The grading for this assignment will be done by another student (with possible arbitration by me) following these criteria:

* The instructions are clear and the sandwich can be made without any clarifications from the person giving the instructions (6 points).
* The instructions are pretty clear and the sandwich can be made with 1 to 2 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (5 points).
* The instructions are fairly clear and the sandwich can be made with 3 to 4 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (4 points).
* The instructions are fairly clear and the sandwich can be made with 5 to 6 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (3 points).
* The sandwich cannot be made with the given instructions without more than 6 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (2 point).
* The instructions are turned in, but the sandwich cannot be made with the given instructions (1 point).
* The instructions were not turned in (0 points).

**Problem GS01-02 (hello world)**
Output “Hello world” to the screen.  Then, make sure to output at least five more lines to the screen.  And make sure that you are the one controlling where the lines end (\n) and the computer is not just wrapping the lines.

## Note for all the programs
Get the user’s name for all the following programs.  Then, make sure to address the user by name when it is appropriate.  You can decide whether to address the user at each input or just at the final output.  Some programs may require you to address the user at each input.  You can decide on the others.

**Problem GS1-03 (Simple math)**

Make an app that calculates a user’s average speed (miles per hour) and average fuel consumption (miles per gallon).  Make sure to address the user when you ask for the input.  Get the appropriate input from the user (miles traveled, hours traveled, gallons used).  Make sure to address the user when you come up with the answer and label the output appropriately.  As an extension, output the average speed to the nearest mile per hour (mph) and the average fuel consumption to the nearest tenth of a mile per gallon (mpg). 

**Problem GS1-04 (Integer Math)**
You are in charge of chartering busses for tour groups.  You need to make sure that each bus is filled to capacity before you hire vans.  Each bus holds 60 people.  Get the number of people going on the tour from the user and then output the number of busses and the number of people left over who will need to ride in vans.  (Use modulus to your best advantage.)  As an extension, calculate the number of vans if the vans can take 7 people.  Give an introduction and ask for the user’s name (put it in a string).  Make sure to address the user when you ask for the input.  Get the appropriate input from the user.  Make sure to address the user when you come up with the answer and label the output appropriately.

**Problem GS1-05 (String Concatenation)**
Have the user input his or her full name.  Get these inputs as first, middle, and last names.  Then concatenate them in two different ways.  First, concatenate them into a full name in order (first, middle, and last).  Then, concatenate them in what might be called legal order (last, first, middle).  In the legal order, also make sure to put a comma right after the last name.  Then, output the two full names (concantenated) with appropriate labels.

**Problem GS1-06 (major program - earthquakes)**
The program will eventually gather earthquake data.  But in the beginning, gather some information about the user.  Get the user’s name (of course).  Then, ask whether the user has felt an earthquake.  Ask what size earthquake the user has felt (0 if never felt any earthquakes).
