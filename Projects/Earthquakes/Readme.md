### Earthquakes
The files included in this folder are about earthquakes.  The files are comma separated values (.csv) files.  You should probably use the CSV module to read the data, but you are not required to do so.  The goal is to look at earthquake data in a variety of ways.  Find out what earthquakes have happened in the past (there is data from a long time ago).  Find out what cities and countries have lots of earthquakes.  Discover the magnitude of different earthquakes.  All the data is there, but in different formats in different files.  You will need to read the data from the different files and use the diverse data to come up with interesting ways to display and report the data.
