# Projects

Projects are the best way to get better at programming.  There are five projects that will be done in a semester.  The first project is to do nine assignments in goal sheets [1](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/PythonWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Problems/GoalSheet01.md), [2](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/PythonWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Problems/GoalSheet02.md), and [3](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/PythonWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Problems/GoalSheet03.md).  The objective is not to do them quickly or haphazardly, but rather to understand the concepts of Input/Output (I/O), variables and constants, math operations, branching, looping, functions, lists, dictionaries, and files.  There are other concepts that need to be learned, but these fundamentals are covered in the first three goal sheets.  Which is why the first project is to do nine assignments form the first three goal sheets.  Students should do more of these programs to get practice with these concepts, but that is also the goal of the other projects.

### The Rubric

The projects listed below are graded according to the Rubric.  There is a simple rubric which gives a general description of how you can look at the projects and a self-evaluation that should be used for all projects except for the Goal Sheet project.

[See the rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/ProgrammingProjects/blob/main/Rubric-ProgrammingProjects.md)

The [Excel file rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/ProgrammingProjects/blob/main/Rubric-ProgrammingProject.xlsx) can be downloaded and used as a self-evaluation tool.  It is more detailed than the rubric page.  You may download it and use it as a self-check and self-evaluation of your project.  Fill it out, print it, staple it to the front of your printed code, and turn it in.

### The Possible and Required Projects List

Two of the four projects must be data projects.  Other than that requirement, you may choose from the following suggestions or create your own project.

| Project | Description | Skills | Data |
| ------- | ----------- | :----: | :--: |
| Rock, Paper, Scissors | Play the game against the computer | I/O, branching, looping |   |


At the time of this writing, there is only one project.  Earthquakes.  Eventually, I intend to create more large projects for students to choose from.  And after that, I hope that students will think of their own large projects.

The projects are data projects.  People who do the projects will read the data from files and do something with the files.  The something is really a combination of somethings.  An interactive interface, graphs, reports, and other things you can do with data.
