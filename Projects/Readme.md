# Projects
At the time of this writing, there is only one project.  Earthquakes.  Eventually, I intend to create more large projects for students to choose from.  And after that, I hope that students will think of their own large projects.

The projects are data projects.  People who do the projects will read the data from files and do something with the files.  The something is really a combination of somethings.  An interactive interface, graphs, reports, and other things you can do with data.

### Earthquakes
The files included in this folder are about earthquakes.  The files are comma separated values (.csv) files.  You should probably use the CSV module to read the data, but you are not required to do so.  The goal is to look at earthquake data in a variety of ways.  Find out what earthquakes have happened in the past (there is data from a long time ago).  Find out what cities and countries have lots of earthquakes.  Discover the magnitude of different earthquakes.  All the data is there, but in different formats in different files.  You will need to read the data from the different files and use the diverse data to come up with interesting ways to display and report the data.
